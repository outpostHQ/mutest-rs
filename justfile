# chock — one-way quality gates. `just` with no argument lists them.
# Exit codes: 0 the gate passed, 1 the gate tripped, 2 the gate could not run.

# Every recipe is an alias for `chock run`: the rule lives in the binary, where it has tests.
# `chock gates` says what each gate measures and which of them `chock run` enforces on its own.

default:
    @just --list
